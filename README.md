# Face-Generator
This project displays my work to design a generative adversarial network (GAN) in order to gernate realistic faces.

There are many hyperparameters and tricks in order to speed up the training and produce realistic faces where the 
discriminator and gernator losses converge to be close to each other while drawing new face images from degenerate 
distribution.
